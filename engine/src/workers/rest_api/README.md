# iii-http

The HTTP Worker exposes registered functions as HTTP endpoints.

## Install

```bash
iii worker add iii-http
```

Resolves from the worker registry at [workers.iii.dev](https://workers.iii.dev/).

## Skills

Install the `iii-http` agent skill for Claude Code, Cursor, and 30+ other agents:

```bash
npx skills add iii-hq/iii --full-depth --skill iii-http
```

## Configure

Runtime settings live in the **`configuration` worker** under id **`iii-http`**. The worker registers its JSON Schema at startup, reads the live value via `configuration::get` (so `${VAR:default}` placeholders in string fields expand against the process env), and hot-applies changes when the value updates.

The config.yaml block below is **seed-only**: it is installed as the initial value on first boot, when no value is stored yet. After that, the configuration worker entry is the source of truth — change settings via `configuration::set` or by editing the persisted file (`./data/configuration/iii-http.yaml` with the default `fs` adapter); both propagate without an engine restart. Edits to the config.yaml block are ignored once a value is stored.

### Sample Seed Configuration

```yaml
- name: iii-http
  config:
    port: 3111
    host: 0.0.0.0
    cors:
      allowed_origins:
        - http://localhost:3000
        - http://localhost:5173
      allowed_methods:
        - GET
        - POST
        - PUT
        - DELETE
        - OPTIONS
```

### Hot Reload

When the `iii-http` configuration changes, the worker re-reads the authoritative value and applies it in place:

- `cors`, `default_timeout`, `concurrency_request_limit`, and `middleware` are swapped without dropping the listener.
- A `host`/`port` change binds the new address first and tears the old listener down only once the new one is live; in-flight requests on the old listener are aborted. If the new address cannot be bound, the change is rejected and the previous server keeps running.
- Invalid values are rejected by schema validation at `configuration::set` time; a stored value that fails to deserialize is logged and the previous config is kept.

Note: `${VAR:default}` placeholders only work in string fields (e.g. `host`) — integer fields like `port` are validated as integers against the schema.

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `port` | number | The port to listen on. Defaults to `3111`. |
| `host` | string | The host to listen on. Defaults to `0.0.0.0`. |
| `default_timeout` | number | Default timeout in milliseconds for request processing. Defaults to `30000`. |
| `concurrency_request_limit` | number | Maximum number of concurrent requests. Must be ≥ 1 (the schema rejects 0). Defaults to `1024`. |
| `cors.allowed_origins` | string[] | Allowed CORS origins. An empty list allows **any** origin; list origins explicitly to restrict. |
| `cors.allowed_methods` | string[] | Allowed CORS methods. An empty list allows **any** method; list methods explicitly to restrict. |
| `middleware` | Middleware[] | Global middleware run on every route (see [Middleware](#middleware)). |

## Trigger Type: `http`

Register a trigger with type `http` to expose a function as an HTTP endpoint.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `api_path` | string | Required. The URL path. |
| `http_method` | string | Required. The HTTP method. |
| `condition_function_id` | string | Function ID for conditional execution. If it returns `false`, the handler is skipped. |
| `middleware_function_ids` | string[] | Per-route middleware function IDs, invoked in order before the handler. |

### Sample Code

```typescript
const fn = iii.registerFunction('api::getUsers', handler)
iii.registerTrigger({
  type: 'http',
  function_id: fn.id,
  config: {
    api_path: '/api/v1/users',
    http_method: 'GET',
  },
})
```

## Request & Response Objects

### ApiRequest

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | The request path. |
| `method` | string | The HTTP method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`). |
| `path_params` | Record\<string, string\> | Variables extracted from the URL path (e.g., `/users/:id`). |
| `query_params` | Record\<string, string\> | URL query string parameters. |
| `body` | any | The parsed request body (JSON). |
| `headers` | Record\<string, string\> | HTTP request headers. |
| `trigger` | object | Trigger metadata: `type`, `path`, `method`. |
| `context` | object | Populated by middleware, available to handler functions. |

### ApiResponse

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status_code` | number | HTTP status code. |
| `body` | any | The response payload. |
| `headers` | string[] \| Record\<string, string\> | HTTP response headers as `"Header-Name: value"` strings or an object such as `{ "Content-Type": "application/json" }`. Optional. |

### Error Envelope

Errors the server generates itself (handler invocation failure, middleware failure or timeout, unmet route condition, route-miss 404s — including URLs that match no route at all — and response-stream build failures) use one stable JSON shape, so clients and AI agents can parse it without guessing:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "HANDLER_ERROR", "message": "human-readable detail", "error_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6" } }
```

- `code` — machine-readable identifier. Engine-generated codes include `MIDDLEWARE_TIMEOUT`, `CONDITION_NOT_MET`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `NOT_FOUND`; handler/condition failures surface the function's own error `code`.
- `message` — human-facing detail.
- `error_id` — present on 5xx responses; correlates the response with server logs. Omitted where there is no log correlation (e.g. timeouts).
- Unmet conditions return `422` with `"skipped": true` alongside the `error` object.

Bodies you return from your own handler or middleware pass through unchanged — the envelope only wraps errors the server raises.

## Middleware

The HTTP module supports middleware functions that run before the handler.

- **Per-route middleware** — attached to a specific trigger via `middleware_function_ids`
- **Global middleware** — set in the `middleware` field of the `iii-http` configuration (seeded from the config.yaml block on first boot, hot-applied via the configuration worker afterwards), runs on all HTTP routes

### Global Middleware Configuration

```yaml
- name: iii-http
  config:
    port: 3111
    middleware:
      - function_id: "global::rate-limiter"
        phase: preHandler
        priority: 5
      - function_id: "global::auth"
        phase: preHandler
        priority: 10
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `function_id` | string | Required. Function ID of the middleware to invoke. |
| `phase` | string | Lifecycle phase. Only `preHandler` is supported. Defaults to `preHandler`. |
| `priority` | number | Execution order. Lower values run first. Defaults to `0`. |

### Middleware Function Contract

Middleware functions receive a request object with `path_params`, `query_params`, `headers`, `method` (no `body`). They must return one of:

- `{ action: "continue" }` — proceed to the next middleware or handler.
- `{ action: "respond", response: { status_code, body, headers } }` — short-circuit and return a response immediately.

### Execution Order

```
1. Route match
2. Global middleware (from config, sorted by priority)
3. Condition check (if configured)
4. Per-route middleware (from trigger config, in order)
5. Body parsing
6. Handler function
```

## Example Handler

```typescript
import { registerWorker } from 'iii-sdk'
import type { ApiRequest, ApiResponse } from 'iii-sdk'

const iii = registerWorker('ws://localhost:49134')

async function getUser(req: ApiRequest): Promise<ApiResponse> {
  const userId = req.path_params?.id
  const user = await database.findUser(userId)
  return {
    status_code: 200,
    body: { user },
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  }
}

const fn = iii.registerFunction('api::getUser', getUser)
iii.registerTrigger({
  type: 'http',
  function_id: fn.id,
  config: {
    api_path: '/users/:id',
    http_method: 'GET',
  },
})
```
