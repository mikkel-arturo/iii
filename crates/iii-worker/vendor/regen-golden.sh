# Regenerate the embedded golden ext4 upper image:
# crates/iii-worker/vendor/upper-golden.iiu.gz
#
# The golden is an EMPTY ext4 filesystem that every worker's writable overlay
# upper is stamped from (see crates/iii-worker/src/cli/upper.rs). It is
# arch-independent (ext4's on-disk format is little-endian regardless of the
# CPU that formats it), so this one artifact serves every guest architecture.
#
# Pipeline:
#   1. Docker (any arch) builds a sparse, empty ext4 image via mke2fs.
#   2. The `gen-golden` example extracts only the non-zero blocks and writes
#      the compressed sparse-extent format that upper.rs reads at runtime.
#
# Requirements: Docker (for mke2fs only) + a Rust toolchain. No host ext4/zstd
# tooling needed; consuming the artifact needs neither (pure-Rust decode).
#
# Bump SIZE_GIB only with care: it fixes the upper's capacity (ext4 can't grow
# without resize2fs). 16 GiB sparse costs nothing until written.
