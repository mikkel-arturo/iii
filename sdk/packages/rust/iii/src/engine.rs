//! Engine function and trigger ids, mirroring the Node SDK constants.
//!
//! This module also re-exports [`RemoteFunctionHandler`] so the engine
//! grouping (`iii_sdk::engine`) exposes the same symbols as the Node
//! `iii-sdk/engine` and Python `iii.engine` submodules. Rust cannot use a
//! separate `pub mod engine { ... }` grouping block here because the real
//! engine module is the file `engine.rs` (`pub mod engine;` in `lib.rs`),
//! so the grouping is folded into this module instead.
